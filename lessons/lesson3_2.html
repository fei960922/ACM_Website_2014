<h1>课程简介</h1>

This is the era of cloud; this is the era of virtualization; this is the era of big data.<br/>

In computers science and software engineering, things come and go, but one immutable theme is the underlying foundation for all: Operating Systems (OS). In many ways, the understanding of OS will determine one’s rise and fall of fortune in this cloudy era.<br/>

This course explains core Operating System concepts and principles from the unique perspective of life’s philosophy and uncovers OS mysteries with logical reasoning. The topics covered include process/scheduling, thread/synchronization, memory/cache, disk/file, input-output, OS adjustment for multi-core environment, and OS design. A main focuses is the explication of the following difficult and delicate topics: logic development of synchronization schemes, implementation of locking, evolution of memory management, and the philosophical principles of operating system design. To broad students’ horizon, half the classroom hours will be devoted to paper critique and discussions that are drawn from OSDI, SOSP, and FAST conference. To give the course of a flavor of modernism, topics of cloud computing and big data will also be touched upon.<br/>
